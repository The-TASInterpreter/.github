# Hello, and welcome to **TASI**! 🙌

Are you looking for a new and exciting way to code? Do you want to learn a simple, intuitive, and consistent programming language? If yes, then you are in the right place. 😊

**TASI** is a new open source programming language that is written in C# and can run on any platform. 💻 It has basic features like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals. 🧮 It is still in development and needs more improvements. 🛠️

**TASI** has a simple and consistent syntax that makes it easy to read and write code. It has six types of tokens or commands: function calls, statements, calculations, strings, code containers, and end commands. It also supports comments, variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and other features.

**TASI** is a fun and experimental language that you can use to create amazing things. 🚀 You can write your code in a text file with the extension `.TASI` and run it with the interpreter. You can also use an IDE or a code editor of your choice.

You can learn more about **TASI** and try it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-TASInterpreter). You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EdD6DDjwt7) server to chat with other **TASI** users and developers.
